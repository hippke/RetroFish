# RetroFish

RetroFish is based on [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org), the strongest chess engine. It aims to port the most recent version to the oldest possible machine, including the NNUE evaluation based on efficiently updatable neural networks.

## Why run Stockfish on very old computers?
My key motivation is an impossible question: Would the artificial general intelligence of the future run on present hardware? Would it run on even older hardware? Perhaps all we need for real machine intelligence is the right algorithm? This problem is also known as "hardware overhang", and I wrote in more detailed about (links [1](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/75dnjiD8kv2khe9eQ/measuring-hardware-overhang), [2](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/75dnjiD8kv2khe9eQ/measuring-hardware-overhang), [3](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/J6gktpSgYoyq5q3Au/benchmarking-an-old-chess-engine-on-new-hardware)).

There is a way to gather some insight regarding these questions. We can take modern AI algorithms, port them backwards as much as possible, and examine the effects. As usual, making real experiments is most useful. 

## Chess engine background

In 1997, the IBM supercomputer "Deep Blue" defeated the world chess champion, Gary Kasparov. The same was possible for chess engines running on standard computers about a decade later. Modern algorithms like Stockfish can beat any human player, even when running on mobile phones. Let us take the best engine of today, and run it on old hardware. Does that even work? How strong will it be?

## How far back can we go?



## How strong is RetroFish?


## Can I play my luck against RetroFish?

Yes, soon! I plan to provide a Lichess bot against which you can play for free. Good luck!
